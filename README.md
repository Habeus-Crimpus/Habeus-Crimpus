# TL;DR About Me
* I earned a B.A. in mathematics ♾️ and philosophy 🤔 from Rutgers University-New Brunswick (2020).
* I mostly work with Python 🐍 and R 📊.
* I have done research in data science, philosophy (ethics), and mathematics education.
* I have been a university-level statistics and English tutor for 4+ years.
* I spend most of my free time climbing 🧗🏻‍♂️, writing ✍🏼 philosophy, and reading books 📖 about data ethics.

# Research Interests

I am fascinated by fuzzy logic and the modeling of subjects that are either irreparably vague or are missing morally decisive information. My most recent work has focused on building ethically-conscious and AI-based recommendation systems for moral blind alleys.

I am currently working on a system for identifying anomalous levels of psychopathic, narcissistic, and Machiavellian traits based on epoch-specific data.

# Highlighted Projects
* 💰 The **Loan Default Prediction Project (Python)** covers the development of multiple classification models that predict whether a borrower will ultimately default on their loan. Utilizing Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn, a random forest model with accuracy and F1 scores over 0.93 is proposed at the optimal model. Complete with a discussion of the surrounding ethical issues, the report offers an robust account of the benefits and challenges of basing loan decisions on ultimately impersonal data. Available at: https://github.com/Habeus-Crimpus/Loan_default/blob/main/Loan_Default_Full_Report.ipynb
* 😈 The **Dark Triad Classification App (Python)** offers supervised machine learning predictions and dynamic data visualizations about levels of agreement with questions used to measure narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism. Available at: https://darktriad1.streamlit.app/
* 🧗🏻‍♂️ The **IFSC Classification Report (R)** summarizes the development of a random forest classification model that predicts with +90% accuracy whether a rock climbing athlete should be considered a potential winner of an International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) competition. Available at: https://github.com/Habeus-Crimpus/IFSC/blob/main/IFSC_Abridged_Report.pdf
* 🎬 The **Movie Recommender Project (R)** covers my work on the Netflix challenge, where Netflix offered a prize for developing a recommendation system that performed better than their own. The report includes a model that performed 9.6% better than Netflix's (then) algorithm. Available at: https://github.com/Habeus-Crimpus/Movielens_Harvardx/blob/main/Movielens_10M_PDF.pdf
