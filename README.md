- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler! I'm an aspiring data scientist.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the probability of vague events, fuzzy logic, and epistemology (especially probabilism).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Python for data science.
- ðŸ“« To contact me, I recommend using the contact form on my website (URL: https://tylerlchang.com). 

I am currently working to collect data from rock climbers in preparation for a larger data science project (likely to completed sometime around July 2023; school takes priority and data collection has proven to be quite slow). If you would like to submit data, please refer to the repository titled Climbing_Performance_Myth_Tester for more information about the sorts of information I am interested in.
