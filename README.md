- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tyler! I'm a graduate student in Sweden.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the probability of vague events, fuzzy logic, and epistemology (especially probabilism).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning stationary stochastic processes, markov chains, and python (for machine learning).
- ðŸ“« To contact me, I recommend using the contact form on my website (URL: https://tylerlchang.com). 

I am currently working to collect data from indoor rock climbers (ideally those who climb at least 2x week) in preparation for a larger data science 
project (likely to completed sometime around July 2023; school takes priority and data collection has proven to be quite slow). If you would like to 
submit data, please refer to the repository titled Climbing_Performance_Myth_Tester for more information about the sorts of information I am interested in.
