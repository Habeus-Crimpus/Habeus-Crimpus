Here are some fun facts about me

- I have been rock climbing since 2011 and can most often outside be found outside work hours at my local climbing gym. I most recently competed at the Copenhagen Rock festival. For any curious climbers reading this, my climbing summary is:

  Hardest Onsights (indoors): 5.13a (7C+) and V8 (7B)
  
  Hardest Sends (indoors): 5.14a (8B+) and V10 (7C+)
  
  Hardest Onsights (outdoors): 5.11b (6C+) and V6 (7A)
  
  Hardest Sends (outdoors): 5.13a (7C+) and V8+ (7B+)
  
  Fastest Speed Wall Time: 10.12 seconds (...in 2018; I am way slower now 🐢)
  
- I read constantly! Though I read philosophy (especially ethics and epistemology) more than anything else, I also regularly read psychology, technology news, graphic novels, Scandinavian mysteries, and sociopolitical news.
- Hiking is greatly enjoyed, if seldom indulged in, hobby of mine (especially in Colorado).
- As a child, I thought that if I taught myself to count cards thinking that I would get rich fast when I became an adult. Imagine my disappointment when I found out that casinos usually ban you for doing that 😭.
